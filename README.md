# YATTA-IVTC 8-133
I did not make YATTA. I will not Modify YATTA or fix any issues with YATTA.

I am simply providing public access to the last known update of YATTA due to the website being down
and all download links being lost.

.

These files have not been modified. 

If you'd like an offical direct download to Yatta 8-133.zip
The files can be found on the Internet Archive/Wayback machine here:
